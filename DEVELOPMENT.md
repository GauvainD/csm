# CSM Development

## Install OpenBabel 3.1.1
Follow the instructions of OpenBabel. It is simple on Windows, and quite vexing on Linux. Good luck!

## Setting up a CSM Development Environment with Visual Studio Code
To develop CSM you need to install Python 3.7, and create a virtual environment in `./env`
Activate your environment and run

```
pip install -r python\requirements.txt
cd python
.\rebuild.bat
```
