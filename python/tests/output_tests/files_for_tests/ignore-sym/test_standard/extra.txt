Molecule: BF3.mol
1 group of length 1
1 group of length 3
The permutation found maintains 100.0% of the original molecule's structure
The permutation found contains 0 invalid cycles. 100.00% of the molecule's atoms are in legal cycles
There are 2  cycles of length 1
There is 1  cycle of length 2
C2 SYMMETRY: 0.351143
